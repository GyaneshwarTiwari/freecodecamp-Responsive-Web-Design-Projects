#FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Curriculum Projects
This repository contains the projects I completed as part of the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Curriculum. These projects were completed while I was learning web development, so they may not be perfect. However, they demonstrate my understanding of responsive web design principles, HTML and CSS.

##Projects
The following is a list of certification projects included in this repository:

1. Tribute Page
2. Survey Form
3. Product Landing Page
4. Technical Documentation Page
5. Personal Portfolio Webpage

In addition to the above projects, this repository also contains the practice projects.

##Technologies Used
The projects in this repository were built using HTML and CSS.

##How to View the Projects
Each project has its own directory with an index.html file. To preview HTML files on GitHub is to go to https://htmlpreview.github.io/ or just prepend it to the original URL, i.e.: https://htmlpreview.github.io/?link_of_HTML_file_on_github. Certification projects preview link has been given below:
